# c_56_recursion_binary_search

## DESCRIPTION

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

Recursion means "defining a problem in terms of itself". This can be a very powerful tool in writing algorithms. Recursion comes directly from Mathematics, where there are many examples of expressions written in terms of themselves. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as: 

> F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2)

This program uses a recursive function to find a number in a given array with binary search algorithm.
